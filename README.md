# All thirty-eight fugue subjects from J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier in **krn format

Source of the original scores: [Scores from the Ohio State University Cognitive and Systematic Musicology Laboratory](http://kern.humdrum.org/cgi-bin/browse?l=osu/classical/bach).

## Methodology

All voices except the one containing the fugue subject are deleted. All notes whose *onset* lies before the onset of the first note of the second voice are considered part of the subject. The bar in which the release of the last note of the subject falls is filled with rests, all remaining bars are deleted and the final barlines are placed at the end of the bar containing during which the last note of the subject ends.
